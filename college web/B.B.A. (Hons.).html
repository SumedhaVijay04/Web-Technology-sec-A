    <h1 class="H2">Course Overview</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="P1">>>  At RV University, we strive to provide students with a holistic outlook on business administration discipline.<br> We like to keep them abreast with the pertinent events so as to prepare them for the future. We encourage<br> students to be curious and courageous to question the existing practices. We equip them with skill-sets to<br> help them deconstruct the existing policies, practices and reframe them for the current needs. RV university<br> believes that change is the only constant and that one needs to at least keep pace with it. We do not limit our<br> curriculum to the conventional courses seen across established institutes. Instead, we endeavour to expose<br> students to contemporary issues such that they can be the harbinger of change that the industry desires. Our<br> curriculum is designed so as to inculcate knowledge through practice and collaboration with industry and<br> academic experts. We at RV university take due cognizance of a studentâ€™s individuality and wish to aid them in<br> their career growth.
    <br><br>
    >>  The curriculum is built to provide a comprehensive understanding of the four pillars of Business<br> Administration: Finance, Marketing, Entrepreneurship, and Business Analytics. Each of these pillars is offered<br> to students to opt from as their major. However, in the spirit of providing freedom to the students, we do not<br> limit a student to courses that they wish to major in. Additionally, we expose students to academic writings,<br> digital literacy, and debates, which do not fall in the scheme of things in most of the schools across the nation.
    <br><br>
    >>  The whole duration of the program is divided into three major parts. The first year is devoted to building a<br> liberal foundation of the students which holds the student in good stead for the future irrespective of the<br> major or area that she/he opts for. The first half of the second year is devoted to the core of general<br> management principles, which entails managerial economics, managerial accounting, operations management,<br> and organizational behaviour. The rest of the duration of the program is devoted to the core topics of the<br> specialization that a student wishes to major in. The last semester of the curriculum enables the students to go<br> in-depth about the career track they wish to take up.
